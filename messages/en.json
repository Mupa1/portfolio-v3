    "description": "I’m Mupa Nzaphila — a frontend engineer with about 3 years of experience building clean, accessible, and high-performance web interfaces. At HEYCAR and ACCURE Battery Intelligence, I developed finance tools used by thousands, optimized dashboards for large datasets, and solved real-world performance challenges. I work mainly with React and Next.js, and love turning complex ideas into intuitive, scalable user experiences. I’m passionate about great UX, thoughtful design, and building products that not only work — but feel great to use."
